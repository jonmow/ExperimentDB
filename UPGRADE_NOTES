Upgrading Notes
+++++++++++++++
If installing a new version of ExperimentDB and not upgrading, none of this needs to be considered.  However if you are upgrading from a previous version, please follow these instructions.  Database schema upgrades will be attempted to be minimized, but when necessary **south** will be utilized.  When a schema upgrade is indicated follow these instructions from within the mousedb/bin directory::

    django schemamigration <INDICATED_APP> --auto
    django migrate <INDICATED_APP>

From 0.2 to 0.3
===============
* This marks the ExperimentDB release in which an upgrade is made to Django 1.3.  To upgrade from Django 1.2.x to 1.3.x two things must be done manually.  First install Django 1.3.x from pip or source.  Second run **python manage.py sqlindexes sessions** to update the index for the sessions app.  
* Manually add the **STATIC_URL = '/static/'** line to the localsettings.py
* Add the following to your apache httpd.conf.  If using something other than apache or you want a different server structure, the key is to serve the static directory to wherever you pointed STATIC_URL::

  Alias /static/ /usr/src/experimentdb/static/  
  <Directory /usr/src/experimentdb/static>
       Order deny,allow
       Allow from all
  </Directory>
