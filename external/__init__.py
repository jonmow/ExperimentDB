"""The external package holds data regarding experimental contributors external to our group.

The idea is to attribute particular models with references regarding external contacts or vendors or to link in specific references important to the experiments or projects.

The two models in this app are:
* Contact
* Vendor
* Reference

The views used by this application are:

In contact.py
* contact-list
* contact-edit
* contact-detail
* contact-delete
* contact-new

In reference.py
* reference-list
* reference-edit
* reference-detail
* reference-delete
* reference-new

In vendor.py
* vendor-list
* vendor-edit
* vendor-detail
* vendor-delete
* vendor-new
"""
